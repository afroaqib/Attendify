Build a Shift Worker Attendance Tracker App.(for this example do not use google login or any login) Main Features I Need  Employees can sign up using Google login (OAuth) and fill a registration form with: Name Phone number Date of birth Department Shift Role After registration, they will log in using Google login (no separate password needed). Employees will be assigned to a Shift and Department. Employees must clock in and clock out every day. Clock-in/Clock-out records will capture the timestamp and geolocation (geofencing). Auto clock-out after shift end if the user forgets to clock out. Show a running timer once clocked in. Calculate lateness if ClockIn is after Shift Start time. Calculate early departure if ClockOut is before Shift End time. Support for night shifts (spanning 2 days, e.g., 8:30 PM â€“ 6:30 AM). Support offline mode (capture clock-in/out data without internet, sync later). Both employees and admins can download/export their own monthly timesheets.  Database Design  (Help me design Google Sheets tables.)  Users Table: Store user profile information (name, phone, date of birth, department, shift, role, email). AttendanceLog Table: Store clock-in/clock-out events (EmployeeEmail, ClockIn, ClockOut, IsLate, LeftEarly, Geolocation, etc.) Shifts Table: Store shift details (ShiftName, StartTime, EndTime). Departments Table: Store departments (DepartmentName). Locations Table (optional for geofencing): LocationName, Coordinates (Lat/Long)  Admin Dashboard  Admins should be able to: View reports (e.g., % of employees late, % who left early). See employee attendance history. Manage user profiles (edit departments, shifts). Edit/assign shifts. Add new locations (for geofencing). Employees should see only their own attendance history.  Automation Requirements  Auto clock-out after shift end time if user forgets. Send notifications: Before shift starts (reminder to clock in). Near end of shift (reminder to clock out). Geofencing: Employees can only clock in within an approved location radius and admin can pin location and control the location radius
